# scrape_twitch.py

# Scrapes monthly statistics tables from TwitchTracker for the four case
# study games used in the "Streamer Effect" project. TwitchTracker does not
# offer a CSV export, and its tables are rendered client-side by DataTables.js
# behind a Cloudflare bot check, so a plain HTTP request will not work.
# Playwright drives a real Chromium browser to clear Cloudflare and let the
# JavaScript template render the table, then we read raw values directly
# from the DOM.

    # Read each row by pulling the data-order attribute from each <td>.

    #      formatted for display (e.g. "1.51M"), so no string parsing needed.
    #   2. The Month cell stores an ISO date (e.g. "2026-04-01") rather
    #      than a localized "Mar 2026" string, which is unambiguous.
    #
    # However, data-order has one quirk: when a cell shows "-" (meaning
    # "no value", typically the oldest row in the table where there is no
    # prior month to compute gain against), the data-order is set to "0".
    # That would silently corrupt the dataset by turning missing values into
    # real zeros. So we check innerText first and emit null when the cell
    # visibly displays "-" or is empty.
