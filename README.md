# The Streamer Effect

Final project for CSCE 567 (Data Visualization). Argues that Twitch viewership spikes causally preceded Steam player count surges across four case-study games: Among Us, Fall Guys, Vampire Survivors, and Lethal Company.

**Live site:** _(Vercel link goes here once deployed)_

## Data sources

- **TwitchTracker** - monthly viewership stats. Manually collected (no CSV export).
- **SteamDB** - monthly concurrent player stats. CSV export per game.
- **Google Trends** - monthly search interest. CSV export per game, date range chosen per game to preserve normalization.
- **Streamer events** - hand-curated, sourced from news articles. Used for clickable annotations on viz 1.

Raw files live in `data/raw/`. Cleaned files land in `data/clean/`.

## Project structure

```

├── data/
│   ├── raw/            # source CSVs (manual + downloads)
│   └── clean/          # cleaned + merged outputs
├── web/                # D3.js single-page site
├── clean_twitch.py     # cleans TwitchTracker CSVs
├── clean_steam.py      # cleans SteamDB CSVs
├── clean_google.py     # cleans Google Trends CSVs
├── merge_data.py       # joins sources, computes lag + growth summaries
└── run_pipeline.py     # runs all four scripts in order
```

## Running the pipeline

Requires Python 3.10+ and pandas.

```bash
pip install pandas
python run_pipeline.py
```

Regenerates everything in `data/clean/` from `data/raw/`.

## Outputs

- `data/clean/master.csv` - all sources joined on (game, month).
- `data/clean/lag_summary.csv` - days between Twitch peak and Steam peak per game.
- `data/clean/growth_summary.csv` - Steam player growth in the month after Twitch peak.

## Visualizations

Built with D3.js. Four charts:

1. Per-game timeline: three normalized series (Twitch viewers, Steam players, Trends score) on a shared axis with streamer event annotations.
2. Gantt-style lag chart showing each game's Twitch peak and Steam peak on a 2018-2026 calendar.
3. Vertical bar chart of post-peak Steam player growth on a log scale.
4. Per-month scatter plot of Twitch viewers vs Steam players with pooled and split-by-game trend lines.

Local preview from the project root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
